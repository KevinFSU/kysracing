At **KYS Racing**, we believe life is too short to drive dirty. Whether you're here to restore your car’s dignity or slap our unapologetically bold logo on your chest, we’ve got you covered.

## About Us

### Who We Are

KYS Racing isn’t for everyone—just the cool people. We specialize in **dry ice blasting** that erases years of grime like it never happened and merch that’ll make your friends question your life choices (in the best way).

### Our Philosophy

We’re here to deliver two things:  
1. **Cleaner cars.**  
2. **Dirtier jokes.**

Let’s face it: a little negativity goes a long way—especially when it makes your car spotless.
